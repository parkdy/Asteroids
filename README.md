Asteroids
=========

Asteroids is a browser-based version of the classic arcade game written in JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. It was created by David Park and Abe Schonfeld. 

Objects in the game move according to Newtonian physics (objects in motion stay in motion). The game's keyboard controls were implemented using event handlers tied to the asynchronous timers that refresh the screen. This allowed for controls that respond smoothly even when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously.
